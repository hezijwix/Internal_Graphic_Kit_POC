# Bug 010: Dynamic Div Sizing Issue

## Description
The div containers for text elements should dynamically resize based on the text content and font size, but they currently maintain fixed sizes.

## Current Behavior
- Text element divs maintain static/fixed dimensions
- Div size does not adjust when text font size changes
- Container boundaries don't reflect actual text space requirements
- Visual inconsistency between text size and container size

## Expected Behavior
- Div containers should shrink and grow dynamically with text changes
- Container size should reflect the actual text dimensions
- When text font size increases/decreases, the div should resize accordingly
- Proper spacing and layout should be maintained with dynamic sizing

## Location
- File: `index.html`
- Functions: Text rendering and layout functions
  - `renderTemplate()` (main layout calculation)
  - All text rendering functions that determine element boundaries
- Issue: Static div sizing vs dynamic text content

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Open

## Technical Details
- Canvas elements currently use fixed positioning
- Text auto-sizing changes font size but doesn't update container dimensions
- Layout calculations don't account for dynamic text size variations
- May need to calculate actual text bounds for proper container sizing

## Previous Attempt
**Dynamic Content-Aware Margins** - Reverted due to implementation issues

The previous implementation attempt included:
- `calculateContentBounds()` function for text dimensions
- `calculateDynamicMargins()` function for adaptive margins
- Updated rendering functions to use dynamic margins

**Issue**: The implementation did not work as expected and was reverted to maintain stability.

## Current State
- All text rendering functions use fixed 230px margins
- System maintains consistent behavior and margin enforcement
- Ready for future implementation approach

## Solution Approach
1. Implement dynamic container sizing based on actual text dimensions
2. Use `measureText()` to determine actual text bounds
3. Update layout calculations to account for variable text sizes
4. Ensure proper spacing is maintained between dynamically sized elements
5. Test with various text lengths and font sizes
6. Consider performance implications of dynamic sizing calculations
