# Bug 009: Text Vertical Centering Issue

## Description
Text elements appear closer to the top of their containing divs rather than being properly centered vertically.

## Current Behavior
- Text appears positioned closer to the top edge of its container
- Visual imbalance with more space at the bottom than the top
- Text does not appear truly centered within its allocated space

## Expected Behavior
- Text should be perfectly centered vertically within its container div
- Equal spacing above and below the text
- Proper visual balance within the text element boundaries

## Location
- File: `index.html`
- Functions: All text rendering functions
  - `renderTopTitle()` 
  - `renderMainTitle()`
  - `renderSubtitle1()`
  - `renderSubtitle2()`
- Issue: Canvas text baseline and positioning

## Priority
Medium

## Status
Open (Solution Implemented - Awaiting Approval)

## Solution Implemented
**Commit**: `7b0fa35` - "Fix bug-009: Implement proper text vertical centering"

### Root Cause Analysis:
The issue was caused by using `textBaseline = 'middle'` which aligns text to the mathematical middle of the font, but doesn't account for visual centering due to uneven font metrics (ascenders vs descenders).

### Technical Solution:
1. **Changed textBaseline**: From 'middle' to 'alphabetic' for more precise control
2. **Added getVerticalCenterOffset() function**: Calculates proper vertical offset using font metrics
   - Uses `measureText()` with 'Mg' to get ascent/descent values
   - Calculates true visual center: `(ascent - descent) / 2`
   - Falls back to `fontSize * 0.8` and `fontSize * 0.2` if metrics unavailable
3. **Updated all text rendering functions**: Apply calculated offset to Y coordinates
   - `renderTopTitle()`: Single line with vertical offset
   - `renderMainTitle()`: Handles both single and multi-line text with offset
   - `renderSubtitle1()`: Single line with vertical offset  
   - `renderSubtitle2()`: Single line with vertical offset

### Changes Made:
- Modified `setTextMeasurementContext()` to use 'alphabetic' baseline
- Added `getVerticalCenterOffset()` helper function for accurate centering
- Updated all text rendering calls to use `y + verticalOffset`
- Maintains existing auto-sizing and margin compliance

### Expected Results:
- ✅ Text appears truly centered within containers
- ✅ Equal visual spacing above and below text
- ✅ Consistent vertical positioning across all text elements
- ✅ Professional typography appearance

## Potential Causes
1. ~~Canvas `textBaseline` setting may not be optimal~~ ✅ **FIXED**
2. ~~Font metrics not accounting for descenders/ascenders properly~~ ✅ **FIXED**
3. ~~Line height calculations affecting vertical positioning~~ ✅ **ADDRESSED**
4. ~~Canvas coordinate system positioning~~ ✅ **IMPROVED**

## Solution Approach
1. ✅ Review canvas `textBaseline` settings (changed from 'middle' to 'alphabetic')
2. ✅ Investigate font metrics and actual text bounds (implemented measureText() analysis)
3. ✅ Adjust vertical positioning calculations (added getVerticalCenterOffset())
4. ✅ Test with different text content to ensure consistency (works with all text types)
5. ✅ Consider using `measureText()` for more accurate positioning (implemented)
