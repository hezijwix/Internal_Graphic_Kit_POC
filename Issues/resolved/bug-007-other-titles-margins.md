# Bug 007: Other Titles Margin Compliance Issue

## Description
Other titles (Top Title, Subtitle1, Subtitle2) need to properly respect the 230px left/right margins for consistency.

## Current Behavior
- Some titles may not fully respect the 230px margin constraints
- Auto-sizing logic may not be consistent across all text elements
- Different margin calculations between title elements

## Expected Behavior
- All text elements should respect 230px left and right margins
- Consistent auto-sizing behavior across all titles
- Uniform margin enforcement for visual alignment
- Text should break or resize when exceeding margin boundaries

## Location
- File: `index.html`
- Functions: 
  - `renderTopTitle()` (line 639)
  - `renderSubtitle1()` (line 786) 
  - `renderSubtitle2()` (line 809)
- Issue: Margin calculation and enforcement

## Priority
High

## Status
Resolved

## Resolution
**Final Solution - Context State Consistency Fix:**
- Created shared helper functions for consistent text measurements:
  - `setTextMeasurementContext()` - Ensures identical canvas context state
  - `restoreTextMeasurementContext()` - Properly manages context state
  - `calculateOptimalFontSize()` - Unified font sizing logic
  - `calculateOptimalFontSizeFor2Lines()` - Specialized for main title
  - `breakMainTitleIntoLines()` - Consistent line breaking logic

- Updated all text rendering functions to use shared helpers:
  - `renderTopTitle()`, `renderMainTitle()`, `renderSubtitle1()`, `renderSubtitle2()`
  - `isTextWithinMargins()` validation function

- Fixed root cause: Text measurement discrepancy between validation and rendering
- All functions now use identical context state, kerning settings, and measurement methods
- Text width calculations are now perfectly consistent between validation and visual rendering

## Solution Approach
1. ✅ Created context state helper functions for consistent measurements
2. ✅ Unified font sizing logic across all text elements  
3. ✅ Consolidated line breaking logic for main title
4. ✅ Updated all text measurement points to use shared helpers
5. ✅ Ensured identical canvas context state between validation and rendering
6. ✅ Fixed visual text overflow issue while maintaining input validation
