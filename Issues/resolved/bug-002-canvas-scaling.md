# Bug 002: Canvas Scaling Issue

## Description
The canvas doesn't grow back when scaling up the browser after shrinking it - doesn't maintain the "fit" feature.

## Current Behavior
- When browser window is shrunk, canvas scales down correctly
- When browser window is enlarged again, canvas doesn't scale back up
- Canvas remains at the smaller size even with larger available space
- "Fit" feature is not maintained during resize operations

## Expected Behavior
- Canvas should scale up when browser window is enlarged
- Canvas should maintain proper aspect ratio during all resize operations
- "Fit" feature should work bidirectionally (both shrinking and growing)

## Location
- File: `index.html`
- Function: `scaleCanvas()` (line 400-416)
- Event listener: `window.addEventListener('resize', scaleCanvas)` (line 826)

## Priority
High

## Status
✅ **RESOLVED**

## Resolution Details
**Date**: Current development session  
**Fixed by**: Senior UI Developer  
**Commit**: `2de5100` - "Fix bug-002: Enable smooth real-time canvas scaling during divider drag"

### Changes Made:
1. **Immediate Canvas Scaling**: Removed debouncing from `handleDrag()` function to enable real-time scaling during divider drag
2. **Code Cleanup**: Removed unused `dragTimeout` variable and related timeout logic
3. **Performance Optimization**: Maintained proper debouncing for window resize events (100ms) while enabling immediate scaling for user interactions

### Technical Solution:
- **Before**: Canvas scaling during drag used `setTimeout(scaleCanvas, 16)` causing delays
- **After**: Canvas scaling during drag calls `scaleCanvas()` immediately for smooth real-time feedback
- **Window Resize**: Properly debounced with 100ms timeout for performance

### Verification:
- ✅ Canvas scales smoothly in real-time during divider drag operations
- ✅ Canvas maintains proper aspect ratio during all resize operations  
- ✅ "Fit" feature works bidirectionally (both shrinking and growing)
- ✅ Performance optimized for window resize events
- ✅ No visual delays or lag during user interactions

## Update Log
### 2024 - Basic Scaling Fixed
- ✅ Fixed basic canvas scaling to fit the div properly
- ✅ Canvas now scales both up and down with browser window resize
- ✅ Maintains proper aspect ratio during resize operations
- ✅ "Fit" feature works bidirectionally

### 2024 - Smooth Scaling Issue ✅ **RESOLVED**
- ✅ **Fixed**: Smooth canvas scaling during divider drag now works perfectly
- ✅ **Current**: Canvas scales in real-time during divider drag operations
- ✅ **Expected**: Canvas scales smoothly without delays - **ACHIEVED**
- ✅ **Location**: `handleDrag()` function - **FIXED**
- ✅ **Status**: Fully resolved and tested
